# Bike_Sharing_Demand_Prediction_Final_Notebook
# Introduction
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis.
# Problem Statement
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the improvement of mobility and comfort. Now It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it reduces the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
